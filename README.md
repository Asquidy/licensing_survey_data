## Description
In 2019, we asked respondents a number of questions regarding what they care about when hiring a professional, and what they know about the occupational licensing status of their contractors and occupational licensing regulations in general. Our survey panel was created by the service ProdegeMR and consists of 12,760 respondents, of whom 5,859 hired a home improvement professional within the past year. 5,219 of those fulfilled additional validation criteria to be considered a reliable response. The survey dates were between February 20, 2019 and March 11, 2019.

- The dataset with the survey responses is available in 'data/p4f6_OCL_Survey_Prodege_Full_20190312_0604.csv'
- The survey codebook is available in: 'data/p4f4_data_dictionary.xlsx'.
